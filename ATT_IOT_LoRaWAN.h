/**
This class provides buffered, asynchronous data transmission features.  

The buffer (a queue) allows the application to gracefully handle situations where the lora network does
not yet allow the device to send data or when the network connection has been temporarily lost.
Delays between messages can be calculated automatically, based on the current transmission speed, or can be set by a fixed value.

The size of the queue is determined by a 'define' called QUEUESIZE. It's default value is 15.

To use this class:
- create an instance and 
- call the Connect() function in order to establish a connection with the NSP. 
- use Send() to send a data packet to the NSP at the earliest convenience. 
- regularly call ProcessQueue() or 'ProcessQueuePopFailed' to make certain that any pending actions are processed.

there are also functions available to manage the buffer:
- `Pop()` remove the first item from the queue
- `IsQueueEmpty()` check if the queue is currently empty (fast method)
- `IsQueueFull()` check if the queue is currently full
- `QueueCount()` get the current nr of elements in the queue

Note: if you want to send data in blocking mode, you can either call 'ProcessQueue' after each 'Send' operation from the queue, or use the
'Send' function of the modem object directly.
