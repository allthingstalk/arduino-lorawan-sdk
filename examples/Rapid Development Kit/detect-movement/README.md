#Detect Movement

An IOT AllThingsTalk Experiment to detect when something is moving in a room and warn you visually via an LED (light emitting diode) and an e-mail.
With this experiment we use a PIR (passive infrared sensor) to detect movement and send an email via an automation rule configured in AllThingsTalk.
This experiment demonstrates two handy automation rules. One to activate an LED and a second to notify you via e-mail when motion is detected.
Itâ€™s a nice example how you could make a security detector, by placing the PIR sensor in a room or closet to protect valuable things you care about.
